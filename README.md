# IPASSIPAS

**IPASSIPAS** is your go-to practice platform for the **IPAS Information Security Engineer Junior** certification exam. Crafted by **Claude (Primary)** and **ChatGPT**, this site features practice questions sourced from [yamol.tw](https://yamol.tw).  

## Features

- **Extensive Question Bank**: 700 questions (though some might feel like dÃ©jÃ  vu ðŸ—¿).  
- **Theme Switching**: Dark/Light mode only.  
- **Answer Review**: Told Claude to implement it, and it actually listened.  
- **Minimal Bugs**: Hopefully, none. ðŸ¤ž
